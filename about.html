          <h3>Who I Am</h3>
          <p>
            Hi, I'm Caleb Nielsen — a passionate and driven developer with a unique background rooted in teaching and
            martial arts. I was born and raised in California, where I was fortunate to grow up near the beach. My
            father is a software engineer, and my mother a grade school teacher, which gave me early exposure to both
            technology and education.
          </p>
          <p>
            After high school, I pursued teaching myself — first as a <b>NASM-certified</b> personal trainer, then as
            the head instructor at a martial arts school, working with students of all ages. These roles helped shape my
            ability to lead, teach, and adapt — skills that now serve me well in the world of software development. I
            currently live in Queen Creek, Arizona with my wife and am focused on growing my career in tech.
          </p>
          <h3>Software Background</h3>
          <p>
            I began learning software development in early 2023 and was immediately drawn in by the creativity and logic
            it demands. Since then, I’ve committed myself to coding almost daily — building projects, exploring
            technologies, and taking courses to deepen my knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a strong foundation in full-stack web development and work with technologies such as <b>Python</b>,
            <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>TypeScript</b>, and <b>C#</b>. I’m currently pursuing my
            undergraduate and working part-time as a full-stack web developer for GearBox Websites.
          </p>
          <h3>Outside of Software</h3>
          <p>
            When I’m not writing code, I enjoy staying active by training in the gym and fishing (especially in the
            ocean). Since moving away from the coast, I’ve also taken up the aquarist hobby to stay connected to marine
            life. I value balance and creativity in life — both of which influence the kind of work I strive to produce.
          </p>
